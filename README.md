## Sudoku Solver

A simple web app that pulls todays' New York Times sudoku games and provides a client showing a solution using a backtracking algorithm.

### Setup

If you would like to host this yourself - clone the repo and then navigate to the server folder. Change the .env.sample port to an open local port and rename the file to .env. Start the API by running -

`npm install npm start`

To run the client, you can either start it without building by navigating to the client folder and running

`npm install npm start`

Or you can build it first and host it on a CDN or some local server by building it with

`npm install npm build`
